# Comparing Sentiment Analysis Performance Across 4 Machine Learning Models of Increasing Complexity

This project applies sentiment analysis to Amazon product reviews to evaluate and compare the performance of four different machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
- LSTM RNN
- DistilBERT

We focus on classifying product reviews as positive or negative, based on review text.
